      "We have been working with On Target for the past year. Carolyn and her team have made the complicated recruiting process much more pleasant. The trademarks of the experience are around-the-clock availability, the ability to go above and beyond throughout the recruiting process, and always finding great candidates. With recruiting not being a straightforward process, they have made the experience easier to undertake and have become our go-to agency for finding suitable candidates across the country. We found them via a referral, and it is my pleasure to refer them to you as well.",
